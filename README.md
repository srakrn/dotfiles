# Sirakorn's (darn lazy) Dotfiles

This is Sirakorn's [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/). Don't know what Dotfiles is? Check that link, it's pretty cool.

## Requirements

There are several manual requirements, as I'm too lazy to create a script to do this by hands. I don't set up new machines that often.

* Install zsh along with [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
    * Skip the part of symlinking Prezto configurations.
* Install Vim (not only Vi) along with [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

## Installation

Simply simlinks all the files to your home directory with `ln`. That should do all the job.
